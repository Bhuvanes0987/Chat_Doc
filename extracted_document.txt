cooperative and collaborative working relationships amongst your team 
members. You must be able to work as efficiently and effectively while availing

 Data privacy, regulatory or contractual constraints from client as per law or 
contract.

is not allowed. For these, you must avail leave allotted to you. 
 
f. 
In case you avail work from home, you must log-in for at least eight (08) 
productive hours. You must maintain timesheets and record details of tasks 
performed. The Manager should validate and approve the time sheets. 
 
g. You can avail work from home for a maximum of twelve (12) days in a year i.e., 
one (01) day per calendar month. This cannot be clubbed with a holiday, 
week-off, or with the previous month’s un-availed work from home time. 
 
h. You need to obtain approval for working from home in advance from the 
Delivery Head. Grant of such option shall be at the sole discretion of Delivery 
Head. Therefore, prior to application in ESS, you are required to obtain an email 
approval from the appropriate authority. Any unapproved work from home 
shall be considered as casual leave. 
 
 
i. 
You must state specific reasons while applying for work from home. You should

considered a suitable option. Therefore, working from home should be availed 
only in exceptional circumstances.

image of the Company.

should wear business formals. 
 
• 
How is the rule applied?

policy in the workplace. The Company recognizes the diversity of its Associates and 
will take a sensitive approach when this affects their dress code.

  LEAVE AND HOLIDAYS 
 
 
The objectives of the leave policy are to ensure that you have adequate time away 
from work for family holidays, special events, rest, and recreation while avoiding the 
build-up of large amounts of annual leave not taken. When the attached practices 
conflict with employment law for an Associate, the law will take precedence. Leave 
for full-time Associates will be as detailed below. 
 
Casual Leave – You will be eligible for four (04) days of casual leave (CL) in a calendar 
year, which will be credited to you immediately upon joining. This is for personal and 
unforeseen work. This leave could be combined with privileged leave in case of 
marriage. Half day leave can be applied in case of emergency. You must inform your 
manager about your absence immediately on commencement of leave. You should 
get the leave approved from your manager within three (03) days after resumption of 
duty, otherwise it will be treated as privileged leave. Un-availed CL at the end of the 
calendar year will not be carried forward. There will not be any kind of encashment for 
unavailed CL and the same will lapse at the end of the year. 
 
Sick Leave – You will be eligible for three (03) days of sick leave (SL) in a calendar year, 
which will be credited to you immediately upon joining. You will be required to produce 
a medical certificate from a certified medical practitioner and relevant medical 
records in case SL is required for more than three (03) days at a stretch. You must inform 
your manager about your absence immediately on commencement of leave. You 
should get the leave approved from your manager within three (03) days after 
resumption of duty, otherwise it will be treated as privileged leave. If you require 
extended SL because of any serious illness or accident, you may inform your manager 
of the same. The duration of the SL may be extended for you. Such extension is 
applicable on a case-by-case basis only and is at the sole discretion of the 
Management. Un-availed SL at the end of the year can be carried forward to the 
subsequent year and it can be accumulated up to ten (10) days. SL, over and above 
the maximum accumulated days so fixed, will lapse at the end of the year. No 
encashment will be allowed for SL. 
 
Privileged Leave – You will be eligible for twelve (12) days privileged leave (PL) in a 
calendar year: one (01) day for each completed month of service. If you are under 
probation, you will not be allowed to avail PL until completion of probation. Until then, 
PL will be credited to your leave balance on pro-rata basis. PL can be accumulated to 
a maximum of twenty-four (24) days. 
 
You must always apply at least fifteen (15) days in advance for availing PL and obtain 
prior approval from your manager. PL should not be prefixed or suffixed to any 
holidays and leave for half a day cannot be considered. PL should not be clubbed 
with any other kind of leaves except CL for purposes of marriage. 
 
Restricted Holiday – Also known as optional holiday is a paid holiday for you to spend 
time with your families or avail it during any unforeseen circumstances. You are 
entitled to avail two (02) days of leave from a stipulated set of six (06) holidays in a 
year.

avail leave during their periods. You can take only one (01) day leave per month

  SMOKING, ALCOHOL & DRUGS 
 
 
• 
What is the Company’s position on smoking? 
Smoking is not permitted on Company property or offices at any time other than in 
the smoking zone of the office. At EXCELENCIA, a smoking zone is specifically 
provided and furnished for smoking. Smoking is accepted to be harmful to the 
health of those who smoke and those around them. Consequently, smoking while 
on company premises will be considered as gross misconduct and will render an 
Associate liable for instant dismissal. 
 
• 
What is the Company’s position on drugs and alcohol? 
The Company is committed to creating and maintaining a safe, healthy, and 
productive workplace for all Associates and has a zero-tolerance policy regarding 
the use of drugs (in any form) on its premises or attending to other business-related 
work on its premises while under the influence of drugs (in any form). Contravening 
either of these points may lead to disciplinary action including termination. 
 
Limiting the consumption of any alcohol made available is the responsibility of the 
Associate. Driving under the influence of alcohol or any form of drug is illegal; it is 
your responsibility to ensure you comply with this.

What is sexual harassment? 
Sexual harassment is any unwanted, unwelcome, or uninvited behavior of a sexual 
nature which makes a person feel humiliated, intimidated, or offended. Sexual 
harassment can take different forms and includes one or more of the following 
unwelcome acts or behavior (whether directly or by implication): 1) physical 
contact and advances; or 2) a demand or request for sexual favors; or 3) making 
sexually colored remarks; or 4) showing pornography; or 5) any other unwelcome 
physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature. 
 
The following circumstances, whether direct or indirect, connected with any act or 
behavior of sexual harassment against an Associate will also amount to sexual 
harassment: 
 
a. promise of preferential treatment or threat of detrimental treatment of the 
Associate’s employment in the Company; or 
 
b. threat about the Associate’s present or future employment status; or 
 
c. conduct of any person which interferes with the Associate or creates an 
intimidating or offensive or hostile work environment for him/her; or 
 
d. humiliating conduct constituting health and safety problems for the Associate. 
 
Sexual harassment can occur between an Associate and a co-worker, supervisor, 
manager, agent, consultant, or contractor. 
 
We recognize that comments and behavior which do not offend one person can 
offend another. Management accepts that individuals may react differently and 
expects this right to be respected. 
 
Sexual harassment is not just unlawful during working hours or in the workplace itself 
but in any work-related context, including conferences, work functions, business or 
field trips, and interactions with clients. 
 
This policy is gender-neutral and applies to all Associates. Matters of sexual 
harassment of men and women alike will be heard and investigated as per the 
provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, 
Prohibition & Redressal) Act, 2013 (the “Act”). 
 
• 
What do I do if I have been sexually harassed? 
If you are being harassed: 
 
a. Tell the respondent that his/her behavior is unwelcome and ask him/her to 
stop. 
 
b. Keep a record of incidents (dates, times, locations, witness, what happened, 
your response). It is not mandatory to have a record of events to file a 
complaint, but a record can strengthen your case and help you remember 
the details over time in case the complaint is not filed immediately. 
 
c. File a written complaint as soon as possible with the Internal Complaints 
Committee 
(ICC) 
at 
complaints.committee@excelenciaconsulting.com

• 
What do I do if the sexual harassment continues? 
If you are working for our Company and in the course of your work, you have been 
sexually harassed by anyone through means which are mentioned above, we urge 
you to come forward with a written complaint as early as you can. Your complaint 
will be taken seriously, and confidentiality would be maintained by us in the matter. 
We will have zero-tolerance towards such practices once they are proven. 
 
A complaint with respect to sexual harassment may be made by a written or 
electronic application addressed to the ICC, through the Presiding Officer. 
 
The complaint must be given to the persons specified above within three (03) 
months of the occurrence (the complaint can be made within six (06) months if the 
person is able to prove that there were some exceptional circumstances due to 
which complaint could not be made earlier) and we advise you to be vigilant and 
keep any document with you which can be used to substantiate an allegation. The 
redressal system will work based on other evidence if you cannot produce any 
documentary evidence. 
 
If the complainant cannot make a written complaint because of physical or mental 
incapacity or death, the legal heirs can make the complaint on her behalf. 
 
• 
What happens after I file the complaint? 
Once the ICC receives the complaint: 
 
a. The respondent will be informed that a complaint has been filed against 
him/her (he/she will be made aware of the details of the allegation and the 
name of the complainant as it would be necessary for proper inquiry), and no 
unfair acts of retaliation or unethical action will be tolerated. 
 
b. The complainant can request for conciliation proceedings in the presence of 
the ICC. Please note that in such conciliation proceeding, the complainant 
cannot demand monetary compensation. 
 
c. The ICC will provide copies of the settlement as recorded during conciliation 
to both the parties. If the matter has been settled by conciliation but the 
respondent is not complying with the terms and conditions, the complainant 
can approach the ICC again. 
 
d. The ICC will question both the complainant and the respondent separately. If 
required, the person who has been named as a witness will need to provide 
the necessary information to assist in resolving the matter satisfactorily. The ICC 
will call upon all witnesses mentioned by both the parties. 
 
e. The ICC can ask for specific documents from a person if it feels that they are 
important for the purpose of investigation. 
 
f. 
The complainant has the option to seek transfer or leave so that the inquiry 
process can continue smoothly and to prevent recurrence of similar situations 
or discomfort to the complainant. The leave can extend for a maximum period 
of three (03) months. Leave granted under this provision will be paid leave and 
will not be counted in the number of leaves that the complainant is statutorily 
entitled to. The complainant may be required to work from home, if it is 
practicable, keeping in mind the nature of work of the complainant, health, 
and mental condition. However, the complainant is under a good faith 
obligation and shall not abuse the process to request unjustifiably long periods 
of leave, keeping in mind the economic effects of the leave to the 
 
 
22 | P a g e 
V e r s i o n 2.0 
I n t e r n a l 
 
 
 
 
 
organization. The ICC shall have the discretion to grant leave of an 
appropriate duration, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, 
or grant an alternate measure such as transferring the Associate or the 
accused, as it deems fit. 
 
Where leave is granted to the complainant, the ICC shall make best attempts 
to ensure speedy completion of the inquiry process and to minimize adverse 
economic consequences to the Company arising out of the absence of the 
complainant from the workplace. 
 
g. The complainant and respondent will be informed of the outcome of the 
investigation. The investigation must be completed within three (03) months of 
the receipt of the complaint. If the investigation reveals that the complainant 
has been sexually harassed as claimed, the respondent will be subjected to 
disciplinary action accordingly. 
 
 The report of the investigation must be submitted to the employer, the 
respondent, and the complainant within ten (10) days of completion of the 
investigation. 
 
 The employer must act on the recommendations of the ICC within sixty (60) 
days of the receipt of the report. 
 
h. The contents of the complaint made, the identity and addresses of the 
complainant, respondent and witnesses, any information relating to 
conciliation and inquiry proceedings, recommendations of the ICC and the 
action taken by the employer should not be published, communicated, or 
made known to the public, press and media in any manner. 
 
Any party aggrieved by the report of the ICC can file an appeal in the appropriate 
Court or Tribunal in accordance with the service rules within ninety (90) days of the 
recommendation been given to the employer. This option is available only where 
a woman Associate has been sexually harassed. 
 
• 
What is the disciplinary action in case of sexual harassment? 
Where any misconduct is found by the ICC, appropriate disciplinary action will be 
taken against the respondent. Disciplinary action may include transfer, withholding 
promotion, suspension or even dismissal. This action will be in addition to any legal 
recourse sought by the complainant. 
 
If it is found through evidence by the ICC that the complainant has maliciously 
given false complaint against the respondent, disciplinary action like the ones for 
sexual harassment will be taken against the complainant as well. 
 
Regardless of the outcome of the complaint made in good faith, the complainant 
and any person providing information or any witness, will be protected from any 
form of retaliation. While dealing with complaints of sexual harassment, the ICC 
must ensure that the complainant or the witnesses are not victimized or 
discriminated against by the respondent. Any unwarranted pressures, retaliatory or 
any other type of unethical behavior by the respondent against the complainant 
while the investigation is in progress should be reported by the complainant to the 
ICC as soon as possible. Disciplinary action will be taken by the ICC against any 
such complaints which are found genuine.

cupboards used by the Associates, or Company vehicles on entering or leaving the 
company premises. 
 
  GIFT & ENTERTAINMENT 
 
 
In connection with certain holidays and other occasions, it is customary in many parts 
of the world to give tips of nominal value to customers, government officials, and other 
parties who have a business relationship with the Company. The Company is 
 
 
25 | P a g e 
V e r s i o n 2.0 
I n t e r n a l 
 
 
 
 
 
committed to ensuring all business relationships with suppliers and clients are legal and 
based on professional integrity. 
 
• 
What considerations should be made? 
When we make a gift to a customer, a government official, or any third party, we 
should keep the following in mind: 
 
a. It is not done to obtain or retain business or gain an improper advantage in 
business. 
b. It is lawful under the laws of the country where the gift is being given and 
permitted under the policies of the client. 
c. It constitutes a bonafide promotion or goodwill expenditure. 
d. It is not in the form of cash. 
e. The gift is of nominal value (on an individual and aggregate basis). 
f. 
The gift is recorded in the Company’s books and records. 
 
When accepting gifts, the same principles apply if a customer or supplier wishes to 
give a gift or any other token of their appreciation. 
 
  ANTI-BRIBERY & CORRUPTION 
 
 
The Company discourages any form of bribery and corruption during its business 
activities. The Company respects all law countering bribery and corruption in all 
jurisdictions in which it operates. 
 
Bribery or corruption means offering or accepting any improper benefit in the form of 
cash, kind, or any other benefit to the following persons in connection with regulatory 
permits, taxation, customs, and judicial and legislative proceedings: 
 
a. A government official at international, national, state, and local level including 
officers of the public sector, private sector and undertaking and other 
government and private agencies. 
 
b. Associates or their relatives or any other person who shall obtain/retain a 
business or personal advantage. 
 
All Associates (including relatives/family members*) and business partners are 
forbidden to offer or accept any bribe and be involved in corrupt practices while 
dealing with/on behalf of the Company. 
 
*“Relatives/family members include Associate’s spouse, children, parents, and siblings. 
 
Any such practice implemented by any Associate through our customer or supplier, or 
service providers and any other business partners is also forbidden and shall be 
considered as involvement in corrupt practices. 
 
Also, it is important that Associates take steps to ensure that third-party service providers 
including SME’s, security agencies, consultants, agents, brokers, lobbyists, tax advisers, 
and other professionals acting on behalf of the Company comply with this Code in 
connection with the Company. 
 
Most bribery and corruption practices stem out from activities such as: 
 
a. Gifts and payment made to secure an advantage in business transactions.

  ASSOCIATE RELATIONS 
 
 
 
  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN 
 
 
A performance improvement plan (PIP), also known as a performance action plan, is 
a great way to give struggling Associates the opportunity to succeed while still holding 
them accountable for past performance. It is not always clear why an Associate has 
poor performance. Therefore, it is critical to allow for an open dialog and feedback 
from the Associate to help determine whether the Associate has all the tools and 
resources necessary for him or her to be successful. PIPs may be used to address either 
failures to meet specific job performance-related issues or behavior-related concerns. 
PIPs may lead to several different outcomes, including improvement in overall 
performance, the recognition of a skills or training gap, or employment actions such as 
transfer, demotion, or termination. Alternatively, a PIP may be used for Associates who 
may be new to a role as a tool to communicate performance expectations. 
 
• 
What are the steps in a PIP? 
 
Document Performance Issues 
The first step in the PIP process is for the Manager to document the areas of the 
Associate’s performance that need improvement. In documenting the main 
performance issues, the Manager should be objective, factual and specific and 
provide facts and examples to clarify the severity or pattern of performance 
concerns further. When developing a PIP, it is a best practice to use a traditional 
format to ensure consistency in the information given to all Associates and to help 
protect the employer should legal claims arise at some point in the future. The 
format of the performance improvement plan will vary by employer and should 
include the following components: 
 
a. Associate information 
b. Relevant dates 
c. Description of performance discrepancy or gap 
d. Description of expected performance 
e. Description of actual performance 
f. 
Description of consequences 
g. Plan of action 
h. Signatures of the manager and the Associate 
i. 
Evaluation of the plan of action and overall performance improvement plan 
 
Develop an Action Plan 
Next, the Manager should establish a provisional action plan for improvement, 
which may be adjusted based on Associate feedback in the meeting. Making the 
process 
collaborative 
can 
help 
in 
identifying 
areas 
of 
confusion 
or 
misunderstanding on the Associate’s part and can encourage ownership of the 
issue by the Associate. This action plan should include specific and measurable 
objectives that are accurate, relevant, and time-bound (otherwise known as 
SMART goals). When developing a PIP, it would be useful to draw on the job 
description and PX policies to identify the performance or behavioral issues and 
expectations. 
 
The Manager should determine if the Associate may need any additional 
resources, time, training or coaching to meet these objectives. The plan should 
identify what management will do or provide to assist the Associate in achieving 
these goals. 
 
29 | P a g e 
V e r s i o n 2.0 
I n t e r n a l 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This action plan should help set performance expectations and should include a 
statement about the consequences for not meeting those objectives. 
Communicate if termination is a possibility. 
 
Review the Performance Plan 
Prior to meeting with the Associate, the Manager should seek assistance from his 
or her manager or an PX professional to review the PIP. This third-party should 
ensure the documentation is stated clearly and without emotion. The third-party 
can also review the suggested action plan to make certain it is specific, 
measurable, relevant, and attainable within the PIP timeline, which will be sixty (60) 
days. 
 
Meet with the Associate 
The Manager must clearly lay out the areas for improvement and plan of action. 
The Manager may need to modify the action plan slightly after receiving the 
Associate’s input and feedback. After making changes to the plan, the Manager 
and the Associate should sign the PIP form. 
 
Follow-up 
The Associate and Manager should establish regular follow-up meetings (weekly, 
biweekly, or monthly), which can be outlined in the PIP. These meetings should 
discuss and document progress toward objectives. It is best when an Associate is 
provided the opportunity for follow-up meetings to ask questions and seek 
guidance or clarification on performance expectations. The Manager should 
ensure that any potential roadblocks are discussed, and that the Associate has 
been provided the necessary tools and training. 
 
Successful progress made toward the goal should be recognized as a means of 
motivating the Associate to continued improvement. 
 
PIP Conclusion 
If an Associate is unable to improve or refuses to commit to the PIP, or if his or her 
performance worsens, then the Manager should close the PIP and consider a 
reassignment, transfer or demotion or terminate employment based on the 
specific circumstances. 
 
When the Associate does show some improvement, but is unable to achieve some 
or all the established action plan objectives within the PIP timeline, there are a few 
options: 
 
a. If the Associate is doing his or her best but just cannot meet one or more 
objectives, the Manager may agree to extend the PIP for a few more weeks 
or months. 
 
b. If the Manager determines, in retrospect, that the objectives were too hard or 
not completely within the Associate’s control, the Manager may decide to 
either extend the PIP or end the PIP due to the progress that was observed. 
 
c. If the Manager determines that the Associate is not a good fit or is not really 
trying to improve even after all this effort, then the Manager should consider 
job reassignment, transfer or demotion, or termination. 
 
When the Associate has responded positively by meeting the objectives, the 
Manager should formally close the PIP and allow the Associate to continue 
employment. This may occur prior to the deadline outlined in the PIP document. 
 
30 | P a g e 
V e r s i o n 2.0 
I n t e r n a l 
 
 
 
 
 
This should be a positive occasion for the Associate, but the Manager must be 
sure the Associate understands that continued good performance is expected. 
 
  DISCIPLINARY POLICY AND PROCEDURE 
 
 
General principles 
We aim to ensure that our people behave in a way that ensures everyone, including 
our customers and suppliers, are treated fairly and without bias or discrimination. We 
encourage behavior that supports and fosters self-discipline and promotes our code 
of conduct. 
Where deemed appropriate, disciplinary measures may be taken when people 
behave in a way that detracts from our ability to deliver a quality service to our 
customers, contradicts our ethics & code of conduct or in any other way perceived 
to adversely affect our company, objectives, or good reputation. 
This policy establishes an equitable and consistent approach to addressing 
unsatisfactory work performance and/or conduct by: 
• 
ensuring the counselling takes place to reinforce the expected performance or 
conduct standards 
• 
establishing a process under which warnings may be issued and discussed 
• 
providing for disciplinary action where performance or conduct does not improve 
 
Definitions 
Counselling: The discussion and analysis of issues which affect an Associate’s conduct 
and/or work performance to find solutions to on-the-job problems. Counselling is 
used to improve an Associate’s performance where their behavior or conduct is 
unacceptable or unsatisfactory. 
Disciplinary action: Action taken by the company to deal with any actual or perceived 
breach of policies, codes, or other standards of work performance and/or conduct. 
Misconduct: Behavior so serious in its nature that it may warrant severe discipline of the Associate 
by the employer including but not limited to instant dismissal 
 
Rights and responsibilities 
All persons have the right to: 
 
• 
have the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness observed, this means: 
• 
the Associate who is the subject of concern must be informed of all the 
allegations in relation to his/her behavior 
• 
the Associate must be provided with the opportunity to put forward their case 
• 
all parties must have the right to be heard 
• 
all relevant submissions and evidence must be considered 
• 
irrelevant matters must not be considered 
• 
the decision-maker must be impartial, fair, and just 
• 
investigations and proceedings that are conducted honestly, fairly and without bias 
• 
no undue delay in investigations and proceedings. 
 
 
 
 
 
31 | P a g e 
V e r s i o n 2.0 
I n t e r n a l 
 
 
 
 
 
It is the responsibility of all parties involved in counselling or disciplinary action to participate 
fully in the resolution process in good faith. Confidentiality must be respected and always 
maintained within the constraints of the need to fully investigate the matter, subject to any 
legal requirements for disclosure and consistent with the principles of natural justice. 
Procedure 
1. Identify the problem. Notify the person of the problem immediately. A lag here could 
imply your acceptance of poor performance or unacceptable behavior. 
2. Discuss the problem and investigate the cause. Conduct formal or informal 
counselling – a private meeting/interview is appropriate to discuss the reasons. 
The person may not necessarily be aware of the problem. 
a. Get a response/reason/explanation. Be prepared to give a fair hearing of and 
proper consideration to any reason or excuses given. 
b. Negotiate outcomes (e.g., training). 
c. Set a period for review. 
d. Make the person aware of the consequences of noncompliance with 
requirements, for example: 
i. your future employment may be reviewed (first warning) 
ii. your employment WILL be terminated (final warning). 
3. Document the outcome. 
a. The person should be allowed to see, sign, and make any comments on this 
file note. 
b. Concentrate on the facts of the situation and the clear quantifiable 
measurements to support these facts. Ensure there is evidence for data. This 
requires good record-keeping to be an essential part of the process, and 
therefore to also be a part of the management practice of the business. 
c. Monitor change. The person should be allowed time to demonstrate 
improvement, in line with the review period and standards set at the 
counselling meeting. 
d. If the behavior persists, function as per the notified consequences. 
 
  GRIEVANCE HANDLING/PROBLEM ESCALATION MECHANISM 
 
 
Misunderstandings and issues are inevitable in even the best working relationships. To 
ensure such situations receive prompt attention, this policy is to assure that you follow 
a formal problem-solving procedure without fear of censure or reprisal. 
 
Whenever any problem arises, you should discuss the problem with your manager 
frankly and sincerely. If your manager is unable to resolve the problem or fails to aid 
satisfactory to you, you should discuss the problem with PX and/or with management 
team. 
 
  EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES 
 
 
The purpose of this policy is to provide a clear understanding of rules about hiring of 
relatives/family members. 
 
• 
Can I refer my relatives/family members? 
Yes. Your relatives/family members are eligible to be hired, but care must be taken 
to ensure that such relative or family member is not in a reporting relationship with 
you.

  CHANGES IN PERSONAL DATA 
 
 
To aid you and/or your family in matters of personal emergency, we need to maintain 
up-to-date information. 
 
Changes in name, address, telephone number, marital status and beneficiaries should 
be communicated to the PX Function promptly. 
 
  VISITORS 
 
 
Visitors such as family members, clients, or prospects and vendors are allowed in the 
office while not disturbing colleagues or office environment. You will be responsible for

  CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
 
 
To be fair, honest, and transparent in all its actions and decisions, the Company expects 
you to avoid obligations to or relationship with any person or business with whom the 
Company competes or does business. Such obligations or relationships could affect 
judgment in fulfilling your responsibility towards the Company and give rise to a conflict 
of interest. 
 
You must avoid any personal activity, investment or association which could appear 
to interfere with good judgment concerning the Company’s best interests. You must 
not exploit your position or relationship with the Company for personal gain. 
 
It is imperative that potential conflict of interest situations is brought to the 
management’s attention in a timely manner and appropriate action is taken. 
 
• 
What does conflict of interest mean? 
When the interests or benefits of one person conflict with the interests or benefits of 
the Company, a conflict of interest is said to occur. We must avoid situations 
involving actual or potential conflict of interest so that even the slightest doubt 
about our integrity is not raised. Conflicts of interest also occur when we or our 
family members receive improper personal benefits, or preferential treatment 
because of our position, or the position of a family member, in the Company. 
Remember that such situations might impact our judgment or responsibilities 
towards our Company and our shareholders and customers. 
 
• 
When could I be faced with a conflict-of-interest issue? 
Some examples include outside employment. If you take part in any activity that 
enhances or supports a competitor’s position or accept simultaneous employment 
with any other company or business entity, it is considered outside employment 
and a conflict of interest. This includes performing services as an Associate, agent 
or contractor for a customer, supplier or any other entity that has a business 
relationship with the Company while working at the Company. 
 
 
 
 
 
37 | P a g e 
V e r s i o n 2.0 
I n t e r n a l 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
What should I do if I have any questions? 
All such situations must be disclosed by reaching out to the PX team. Remember, 
having a conflict-of-interest situation may not necessarily be so. When faced with 
such issues, ask yourself: 
a. Would this create or appear to create an unfair incentive for me or my friends 
and family? 
b. Am I putting the Company at risk of violating laws or agreements with our 
customers? 
c. Would this look bad if it were brought up in social media? 
d. Would this distract me from doing my job? 
 
You must also disclose your potential conflict of interest on an annual basis to your 
PX. You should continue to disclose such circumstances each year in your annual 
Code of Conduct training if the potential conflict is ongoing. Since the situations for 
other conflicts of interest are wide and many, it would be impractical to attempt 
to list all situations. If a proposed transaction or situation raises any questions or 
doubts, you should raise it PX. 
 
Where there are external involvements that do not represent a conflict of interest, 
these must not affect performance or attendance whilst working. If such 
involvement does affect performance or attendance, it will be considered as a 
conflict of interest giving rise to the remedies described above or disciplinary 
proceedings including dismissal. 
 
  ACCESS & IDENTITY CARD 
 
 
At the time of joining, Company shall provide you a Photo ID and access card. You are 
expected to wear your access card and ID card in the Company premises. However, 
in case you lose or misplace the ID card or access card, you must report the same 
immediately to PX to avoid its misuse by unauthorized persons and the cost of the 
replacement will be recovered accordingly. The Access/ID card must be surrendered 
when you leave the Company and the same should be handed back to PX. Issue of 
duplicate cards shall involve a cost of Rs. 500 (Rupees Five Hundred).

competitors or harmful to the Company if disclosed. We must take care to ensure that 
all confidential information is used only for Company business purposes. Upon joining, 
you will sign a Confidentiality and Non-disclosure Agreement which details your 
confidentiality obligations to the Company. As an Associate, you will have access to 
significant amounts of Company information that may not be available to the public, 
and you should preserve the confidentiality of information obtained in the Company’s 
service. Information of a confidential, private, and sensitive nature must be used 
responsibly and controlled and protected to prevent its prohibited, arbitrary, or careless 
disclosure. Unless the Company has provided its specific consent, which should 
preferably be in writing, or there is a legal or professional right or duty to disclose, you are 
prohibited from disclosing confidential Company information. Confidential or 
proprietary information about clients, our organization, or other parties, which has been 
gained through employment or affiliation with the Company, may not be used for 
personal advantage or for the benefit of third parties. You are also responsible for 
properly labelling all documentation. This responsibility includes the safeguarding,

proceedings including dismissal. 
 
You have the obligation to identify and protect IPs of the Company. The obligation is 
not only in current relationship capacity but also for all future periods. Even in case this

respect the intellectual and protected information of others including its customer and 
business partners.

we are committed to giving all members of our team every opportunity to develop their 
careers, to contribute to our business and to share its success.

approach. 
 
  PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY 
 
 
We believe that everyone who comes to work really does want to realize their potential 
and develop their relationships with others. 
 
Work is characterized by feelings of satisfaction, frustration, opportunity, exasperation, 
stimulation, excitement and even feelings of fairness and dishonesty. To succeed and 
excel, we recognize that people need to know what is expected of them, what 
authority they have and how they are performing. In addition, the approach to 
managing them needs to be consistent. 
 
If our organization can help its people feel more of the positive emotions and eliminate 
most of the negative ones, then we will have come a long way to be an employer of 
choice. 
 
The Performance Management System is designed to be the foundation for fulfilling 
careers. 
 
• 
How does the Company put the performance management system into action? 
The first step towards a successful performance management system is drafting 
key result areas (KRA) for each Associate.

Management and used as the basis for performance appraisals. These are 
dynamic as deemed necessary by Managers.

What is the process of allotting KRAs? 
All Associates will receive individual briefings on their KRAs from their Manager. 
 
KRAs will always be discussed in detail at job interviews and all new Associates are 
to be given a copy of their KRAs with their appointment offer, if required.
